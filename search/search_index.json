It is to be used with a Debug world and will put all players into spectate mode and teleport them at a configured interface to each block in succession with the block number shown in the action bar. It will also write the full state of the block along with the shown number to a json file. It will start with the block at (1 70 1) and will continue till it cannot find any more blocks. The first block is always assumed to be air. This allows comparing block states in Minecraft Java Edition, Minecraft Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education Edition. Video How to Use \u00b6 Generate a Debug world by creating a single player world and holding shift when selecting type. One of the options will be Debug. Issue the following command: Example /gamerule randomTickSpeed 0 Import the world into spigot by copying the save file and renaming to world. You will also need to rename level_old.dat to level.dat or copy a level.dat from a non debug world (note if you do this you'll need to set the gamerule again on first load). Start up the server and join the world Use the following command to start: Example /debugscanner start [-start {block number}] [-interval {ticks}] [-pitch {pitch}] [-yaw {yaw}] To stop early use the following command: Example /debugscanner stop It's best to use as screen recorder, then save the recording along with the accompanying blocks.json file.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"#how-to-use","text":"Generate a Debug world by creating a single player world and holding shift when selecting type.
